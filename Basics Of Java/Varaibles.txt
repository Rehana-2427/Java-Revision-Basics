## 📌 Variable Declaration & Initialization in Java

### 1. Declaration

* Reserves memory for a variable.
* Only tells the compiler the **data type + name**, no value yet.

```java
int age;
```

🖼️ Diagram:

```
[ age ] →  (empty, waiting for value)
```

---

### 2. Initialization

* Assigns the **first value** to a declared variable.

```java
age = 25;
```

🖼️ Diagram:

```
[ age ] →  25
```

---

### 3. Declaration + Initialization (Single Line)

* You can declare and assign a value at the same time.

```java
int age = 25;
```

🖼️ Diagram:

```
[ age ] →  25  (created and initialized together)
```

### 4. Key Points

* A variable **must be declared** before use.
* A variable **must be initialized** before accessing its value.
* Declaration and initialization can be done **in two steps or in one step**.
