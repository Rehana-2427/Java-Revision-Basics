# 📌 Primitive Data Types in Java

Java has **8 primitive data types**:
👉 `byte, short, int, long, float, double, char, boolean`

They are called *primitive* because they are the most basic building blocks of Java programs.

---

## 1. Integer Types (store whole numbers)

### (a) **byte**

* Size: **1 byte (8 bits)**
* Range: **-128 to 127**
* Example:

  ```java
  byte age = 25;
  ```

---

### (b) **short**

* Size: **2 bytes (16 bits)**
* Range: **-32,768 to 32,767**
* Example:

  ```java
  short year = 2024;
  ```

---

### (c) **int**

* Size: **4 bytes (32 bits)**
* Range: **-2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647**
* Example:

  ```java
  int population = 1000000;
  ```

---

### (d) **long**

* Size: **8 bytes (64 bits)**
* Range: **-9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807**
* Example:

  ```java
  long distance = 123456789L;  // Notice the L at the end
  ```

⚠️ Important: Large numbers must end with **L** (capital or small).

---

## 2. Floating-Point Types (store decimal numbers)

### (a) **float**

* Size: **4 bytes (32 bits, single precision)**
* Range: \~ ±3.4e−038 to ±3.4e+038
* Example:

  ```java
  float weight = 68.5F;  // Must add F
  ```

---

### (b) **double**

* Size: **8 bytes (64 bits, double precision)**
* Range: \~ ±1.7e−308 to ±1.7e+308
* Example:

  ```java
  double height = 178.6;
  ```

⚠️ Important: By default, Java treats decimal numbers as **double**.
Use `F` only when you want **float**.

---

## 3. Character Type

### **char**

* Size: **2 bytes (16 bits, Unicode)**
* Stores a **single character** (letter, number, or symbol).
* Example:

  ```java
  char grade = 'A';
  char grade2 = 65; // Unicode value → 'A'
  ```

---

## 4. Boolean Type

### **boolean**

* Size: **1 bit (depends on JVM, but logically true/false only)**
* Values: **true** or **false**
* Example:

  ```java
  boolean isStudent = true;
  ```

---

## 5. Key Rules About Variables

* Must start with a **letter, underscore (\_) or dollar sign (\$)**.
* Cannot contain spaces or special characters.
* Are **case-sensitive** (`age` and `Age` are different).
* Must be **declared before use**.
* Should be **initialized before accessing value**.
